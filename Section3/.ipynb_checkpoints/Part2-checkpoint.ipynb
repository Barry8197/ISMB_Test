    "# <font color='darkblue'>Smoking Network Classification using Graph Convolutional Networks</font> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 4 - Machine Learning for Networks (lead Barry)\n",
    "- talk introducing ML methods specifically adapted for graphs from first principles\n",
    "- notebooks covering\n",
    " - implementation examples for a couple of GNN model types\n",
    " - an example analysis using one of the toy examples\n",
    " - a skeleton for analysis of the GenScot network\n",
    " \n",
    "<font color='darkgreen'> Idea so far : </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the [EWAS Catalog](https://www.ewascatalog.org/?trait=smoking) get a list of CpG sites and genes relating to smoking\n",
    "2. Subset to matching CpG sites in the methylation data\n",
    "3. Swap CpG sites to corresponding Gene (obtained from EWAS)\n",
    "4. Generate smoking \"disease\" PPI network from [StringDB](https://string-db.org)\n",
    "5. Build a data graph dataset which incorporates the Gen Scot methylation data\n",
    "6. Build a graph classifier which can predict Gen Scot participants who have or have not smoked\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'> TO DO </font>\n",
    "1. Incorporate Seb's GNN's\n",
    "        1.1 Good to get Seb's help & input on this\n",
    "~~2. Faster baseline implementation -> Logistic Regression CV is too slow~~\n",
    "3. Improve comments and explain each section\n",
    "4. Mapping CpG's to genes is not a 1:1 mapping. Genes will be associated with multiple CpG's and vice versa. Need to identify a way better accounts for this\n",
    "        4.1 Currently aggregating by mean and dropping cpgs with multiple genes\n",
    "        4.2 Could add extra edges ? \n",
    "                4.2.1 Extra edge for two CpG's which are invovled in the same gene\n",
    "                4.2.3 Add nodes and edges between genes which are impacted by the same CpG\n",
    "5. Beat Logistic Regression Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='Blue'> Updates </font> <br>\n",
    "Looks like network needs to be imrpoved. The average node degree is 3 which means that all the relationships are being smoothed out. We want a dense network with meaningful interactions. \n",
    "* Have tested with node features for 1 smoker 0 never and got 100% acc -> Model works fine\n",
    "* Have also test with logistic regression on the node features without a network ~78% accuracy. Small drop off from baseline but close enough\n",
    "* Began looking at a patient similarity framework too. Can measure similarity based off the smoking phenotypes\n",
    "    * Accuracy around 65% - improvement but not great\n",
    "    * potential to use gcn-mme from MOGDx? \n",
    "* Also playing around with looking at measuring similarity based off StringDB interactions **np.matmul(PatxGene , PPI)**\n",
    "    * Similar accuracy\n",
    "* This again is falling into the smoothing issue where the network has so few interactions that the scores become uniform. Likely what is happening with the graph classification too\n",
    "* I also added a for loop to the PPI StringDB whereby we now include all genes. The issue with this method is that it assumes genes in seperate for loops do not interact. Probably explains why the degree of the network is so low. \n",
    "* Next steps has to look at how we are developing the network and how to best generate this -> Stay with StringDB? \n",
    "    * Filtering Network definitely improves performance -> Increasing connectivity is important\n",
    "    * Might be better to cluster the large network and select biggest cluster?\n"
