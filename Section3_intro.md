# Introduction to Graph Neural Networks
Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are a powerful architecture for the learning of graph structure and information in a supervised setting. In this workshop we will implement a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model from the Deep Graph Library in Python with a PyTorch backend. 

The differentiation between GCN and neural network architectures is their ability to learn from the local neighbourhood as opposed to handcrafted network features. The performance of GCN and other GNN architectures has been demonstrated on a variety of benchmark tasks, hence extending their application to a biomedical setting is an exciting avenue.
